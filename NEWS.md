# CarletonStats 2.2

* The `boot*()` functions now return the bootstrap statistics as a `carlboot` object, which has `print`, `plot`, `summary`, and `confint` methods.

* The `permTest*()` functions now return the bootstrap statistics as a `carlperm` object, which has `print`, `plot`, and `summary` methods.

* Additional arguments were added to the `boot*()` and `permTest*() functions: `xlab`, `ylab`, `title`, `seed`.

* Some arguments were deleted from the `boot*()` functions: `legend.loc` (just use ggplot2 theme if needed), `hist.title` (now use `title`)

* All plots generated by the `boot*()` and `permTest*()` functions are now rendered via ggplot2.
